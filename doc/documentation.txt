jquery-awesomeGrid documentation:

With this library you can create amazing UI based on grids like new Windowis 8 
interfaces.

This plugin uses several divs to create the grid and another one to wrap it. It
has a basic interaction when the user clicks on a cell. This interaction enlarges
the clicked cell and minimize the others. Also is possible to hook functions to
perform actions when enlargin and restoring cells.

The plugin requires JQuery 1.8+.

The main parameters of the plugin are:

	* gridDef: Array with grid definition. The structure of this array is
		explained below.
		
	* animate: Boolean true or false to enable or disable cell animation 
		on enlarge/restore.

	* duration: Integer to set the animation's duration, this parameter is 
		passed to JQuery function "animate".

	* easing: String to set easing mode for animation. By default it supports
		"swing" and "linear" values. This variable is passed to JQuery function
		"animate".

	* resize_callback: Function that will be executed when a cell is enlarged.
		A cell is enlarged when the user clicks on the div that represent the
		cell. The function receives a plain object with cell position as a 
		parameter,(pos.r = row, pos.c = column).

	* restore_callback: Function that will be executed when the grid is restored.
		The grid will be restored when:
			a.- An enlarged cell is clicked the second time.
			b.- The user clicks on a minimize cell.
		The functions receives a plain object with cell position as a parameter,
		(pos.r = row, pos.c = column).

** GRID DEFINITION **

The parameter "gridDef" expected an array with the grid's definition as follows:

	gridDef = new Array();

	gridDef[1] = {"cells": 3, 
		"minCellWidth": "39px",
		"minCellHeight": "39px",
		"maxCellWidth": "791px",
		"maxCellHeight": "457px",
		"disabled_cells": [1]
	};

	gridDef[2] = {"cells": 2, 
		"minCellWidth": "39px",
		"minCellHeight": "39px",
		"maxCellWidth": "871px",
		"maxCellHeight": "424px"
	};

Each element of the array defines the structure of each grid row. The parameters
of each row are:

	* cells: Integer with the number of cells for this row.

	* minCellWidth: String with min width for cells in pixels. The width 
		the cell takes when another cell is enlarged.

	* minCellHeight: String with min height for cells in pixels. The height 
		the cell takes when another cell is enlarged.

	* maxCellWidth: String with max width for cells in pixels. The width a 
		cell takes when it is enlarged.

	* maxCellHeight: String with max height for cells in pixels. The height a 
		cell takes when it is enlarged.

	* disabled_cells: Array of integers with the position of the cells that
		will have the click action disabled. These cells will do nothing when
		the user clicks on them.

There is no limit to the number of rows and columns the plugin support, but is very 
important to notice that you must have the same number of divs created in you code
as you defined in the grid definition.
